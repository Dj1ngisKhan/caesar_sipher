# Encryption, Decryption and Brute Force

## Caesar Cipher based encryption, with a little twist....

Just download and run the code, and then it should be pretty self-explanitory what to do.

## Three Options:

So, there are 3 options...

- You could either encrypt a message based on my encryption function.

- If you run the same function, you would also be able to decrypt the same message or any other cipher message encrypted with this function.

- Lastly, if you dont have or remember your encryption/decryption key - you could just brute-force the encrypted message - with the same function.
  The last option is called "Brute force" from the dropdown-menu.

So play around with it through different ways. Try it at least, pretty cool - but nothing safe to encrypt any message with!
